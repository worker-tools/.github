# Worker Tools

Worker Tools are a collection of TypeScript libraries for writing web servers in [Worker Environments][wkrs] such as [Cloudflare Workers][cfws] and [Deno Deploy][dndp]. 

## Tools
- 🧭 [__Worker Router__][router] --- Complete routing solution that works across CF Workers, Deno and Service Workers
- 🔋 [__Worker Middleware__][middleware] --- A suite of standalone HTTP server-side middleware with TypeScript support
- 📄 [__Worker HTML__][html] --- HTML templating and streaming response library
- 📦 __Storage Area__ --- Storage abstractions for [Cloudflare's KV][cloudflare-kv-storage] and [Deno][deno-kv-storage]
- 🆗 [__Response Creators__][response-creators] --- Factory functions for responses with pre-filled status and status text
- 🎏 [__Stream Response__][stream-response] --- Use async generators to build streaming responses for SSE, etc...
- 🥏 [__JSON Fetch__][json-fetch] --- Drop-in replacements for Fetch API classes with first class support for JSON.
- 🦑 [__JSON Stream__][json-stream] --- Utilities for working with streaming JSON.
- 🍪 [__Request Cookie Store__][request-cookie-store] --- An implementation of the Cookie Store API for use in request handlers.
- ⏱ [__Extendable Promise__][extendable-promise] --- A promise that can be delayed/extended via repeated calls to `waitUntil`.
<!-- - 🍪 [__Signed Cookie Store__][signed-cookie-store] --- An implementation of the Cookie Store API for use in request handlers. -->
<!-- - 🍪 [__Encrypted Cookie Store__][encrypted-cookie-store] --- An implementation of the Cookie Store API for use in request handlers. -->
<!-- - ⏱ [__Resolvable Promise__][resolvable-promise] --- A promise that is resolvable or rejectable after it was created. -->

Worker Tools also includes a number of polyfills that help bridge the gap between different Worker Runtimes:
- ✏️ [__HTML Rewriter__](./html-rewriter) --- Cloudflare's HTML Rewriter for use in Deno, browsers, etc...
- 📍 [__Location Polyfill__](./location-polyfill) --- A `Location` polyfill for Cloudflare Workers.
- 🦕 [__Deno Fetch Event Adapter__](./deno-fetch-event-adapter) --- Dispatches global `fetch` events using Deno’s native HTTP server.

Worker Tools also maintains a number of (web-) services:
- ⚙️ [__workers.js.org__][wkrs] --- Educational site about the state of Worker Runtimes.
- 🦕 [__ghuc.cc__][ghuc] --- Import modules directly from GitHub into Deno with a familiar API. 
<!-- - 🗞 [__worker-news.deno.dev__][news] --- A drop-in replacement for Hacker News, built entirely with Worker Tools. -->

***

Worker Tools can be used independently or as a web framework via [__Shed__](https://github.com/worker-tools/shed). 

## How to Use
__Deno__ users can import Worker Tools directly from GitHub as they are written in TypeScript with fully qualified import specifiers:

```js
import * as shed from 'https://ghuc.cc/worker-tools/shed/index.ts'
```

For __other environments__ such as module bundlers, webpack or esbuild, Worker Tools are distributed as node-ified modules that can be installed via __npm__ and behave like regular npm modules

```sh
npm install @worker-tools/shed
```
